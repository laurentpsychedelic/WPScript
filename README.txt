# Scripting language WPScript interpreter #
###########################################

This is a little project in which I implement a script language interpreter
for a new language (called WPScript) written in Java.

It uses "antlr" for the parsing, abstract syntax tree (AST) generation job.

This is essentially for educative purpose and is not planned to be used in
production as is for the moment.
